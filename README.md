Title: Examining the successful factors that contribute to a high Airbnb rating. <br/>
Objective: Airbnb is a worldwide success, allowing anybody eligible to sign onto the business and rent out their homes for a temporary stay. However, the success of a host is not guaranteed: it is highly subjective and based on customer reviews. This project was created to pinpoint the factors that contribute to a high rating in order to deliver a guide to new hosts on Airbnb.
